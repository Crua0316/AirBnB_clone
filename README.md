# AirBnB_clone

The objective of the project is to recreate a copy of the AirBnB website, with a series of tasks until the website is completed. The first part consists of developing the console, this goes from the back-end side with the Python programming language.

# What's a command interpreter?

A command interpreter is the part of a computer operating system that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively by a human being or from a program. In some operating systems, the command interpreter is called the shell.

# Using the Console

The clone AirBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution of the file console.py at the command line.

$ AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
